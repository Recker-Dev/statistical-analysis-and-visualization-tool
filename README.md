# Data Analysis and Visualization: Query Mark Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing data and visualizing statistical metrics based on user input. It allows users to input specific data, select columns, and analyze query marks with statistical details such as Z-Scores, Percentiles, and Probability Density functions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing or non-numeric values by converting them to 0, and ensures data integrity for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes and visualizes statistical details like Mean, Median, Mode, Skewness, Kurtosis, and more.
- **Visualization**: Displays a histogram of the data with a normal distribution curve, alongside detailed statistical information.
- **Query Mark Analysis**: Allows users to input a specific mark and receive a Z-Score, Percentile, and Probability Density for the queried value.
